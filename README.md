### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Hunter Monroe, I am a former hospitality professional turned Front End Developer. In my previous career I learned problem-solving in a fast-paced environment, I learned that not all problems are the same and you canâ€™t always use what worked before. I had to communicate and collaborate with people from all over the world. I had to manage my time extremely well to ensure deadlines, budgets and coordination for events were met I ensured all services were performed up to standard.  As my career progressed, I noticed a huge increase in the importance of technology and the roles it plays in our daily lives. I decided to take a risk and jump headfirst into the world of tech. My problem-solving skills, persistence and enthusiasm for tech make me a great candidate for your company. Thank you for taking the time to read about me, please feel free to reach out to me.
